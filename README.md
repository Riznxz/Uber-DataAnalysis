# 🚕 Uber Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Uber Data Analysis** project! 📊 This notebook dives deep into Uber ride data to uncover trends in user behavior, demand patterns, and temporal usage insights. Whether you're a data enthusiast or a beginner, this project showcases how to turn raw data into meaningful business insights using Python.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project explores real-world Uber ride data to answer key questions like:

- ⏰ When do most Uber rides occur?
- 📍 What are the busiest pickup locations?
- 🗓️ How does ride demand vary across weekdays vs weekends?
- 📈 Are there patterns in usage during different months?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- 🐍 **Python**
- 📦 **Pandas** – data manipulation
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
- 📅 **Datetime** – time series analysis
- 🧼 **Data cleaning & wrangling**

---

## 📌 Key Features

- Grouped rides by **hour, day, and month** to observe time trends
- Identified **peak hours** and **busiest days**
- Visualized **ride frequency by location and time**
- Created **bar plots, heatmaps, and line charts**
- Ensured **clean, readable visualizations** for presentation

---

## 📈 Insights & Findings

- 🚨 Most rides occur between **5 PM and 8 PM**
- 🏙️ Central city areas have **highest pickup frequencies**
- 📆 Weekends show a slight dip in early morning rides
- 🌡️ Seasonal variation affects demand during holiday months

## 📂 Project Overview

This project explores real-world Uber ride data to answer key questions like:

- ⏰ When do most Uber rides occur?
- 📍 What are the busiest pickup locations?
- 🗓️ How does ride demand vary across weekdays vs. weekends?
- 📈 Are there patterns in usage during different months?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 📦 **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for plotting and visualization
- 🗂️ **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- 🧼 **Datetime** – for handling timestamps

---

## 🧾 Project Steps

### 🔹 1. Data Loading & Preparation
- Loaded Uber dataset (CSV format)
- Parsed **timestamps** into proper datetime format
- Checked and handled missing values
- Extracted **hour, day, month, and weekday** from datetime

### 🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Grouped data by **hour, weekday, and month**
- Identified trends and peak hours using descriptive stats
- Checked distributions of pickups across time and location

### 🔹 3. Data Visualization
- 📊 **Bar plots** to show ride demand by weekday & hour
- ⏱️ **Line plots** for hourly and monthly ride trends
- 🗺️ **Heatmaps** to visualize usage intensity by time of day
- 🎯 **Pie charts** for location-wise demand share

### 🔹 4. Insights & Interpretation
- Derived clear business insights from visual patterns
- Recommended potential strategies for Uber based on findings

---

## 📈 Insights & Findings

- 🚨 Most rides occur during **evening rush hours (5 PM – 8 PM)**
- 🏙️ **City centers** dominate as popular pickup locations
- 📅 **Weekdays show more structured ride patterns**; weekends are more scattered
- ❄️ Monthly ride frequency shows drops during certain seasons — suggesting **weather or holidays influence**

---

## 📸 Visual Examples

> 📷 This notebook includes:
> - Time-series line plots
> - Categorical bar plots
> - Correlation heatmaps
> - Day-Hour usage heatmaps
