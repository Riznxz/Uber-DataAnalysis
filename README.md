# 🚕 Uber Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my **Uber Data Analysis** project! 📊 This notebook dives deep into Uber ride data to uncover trends in user behavior, demand patterns, and time-based usage insights. Whether you're a data enthusiast or beginner, this project shows how raw data becomes meaningful business insight using Python.

---

## 📂 Project Overview

This project explores real-world Uber ride data to answer key questions like:

- ⏰ When do most Uber rides occur?
- 📍 What are the busiest pickup locations?
- 🗓️ How does ride demand vary across weekdays vs. weekends?
- 📈 Are there patterns in usage during different months?

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 📦 **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- 📊 **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for plotting and visualization
- 🗂️ **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- 🧼 **Datetime** – for handling timestamps

---

## 🧾 Project Steps

### 🔹 1. Data Loading & Preparation
- Loaded Uber dataset (CSV format)
- Parsed **timestamps** into proper datetime format
- Checked and handled missing values
- Extracted **hour, day, month, and weekday** from datetime

### 🔹 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Grouped data by **hour, weekday, and month**
- Identified trends and peak hours using descriptive stats
- Checked distributions of pickups across time and location

### 🔹 3. Data Visualization
- 📊 **Bar plots** to show ride demand by weekday & hour
- ⏱️ **Line plots** for hourly and monthly ride trends
- 🗺️ **Heatmaps** to visualize usage intensity by time of day
- 🎯 **Pie charts** for location-wise demand share

### 🔹 4. Insights & Interpretation
- Derived clear business insights from visual patterns
- Recommended potential strategies for Uber based on findings

## 📈 Insights & Findings

- 🚨 Most rides occur during **evening rush hours (5 PM – 8 PM)**
- 🏙️ **City centers** dominate as popular pickup locations
- 📅 **Weekdays show more structured ride patterns**; weekends are more scattered
- ❄️ Monthly ride frequency shows drops during certain seasons — suggesting **weather or holidays influence**
